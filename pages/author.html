                Hi, my name is Markus Hecker. I am a student at the Ruhr-University Bochum in germany 
                during my master's degree in IT-Security. Since I was 13 I love making games in my free time
                what's probably the reason I learned programming in the first place.
                Making a game for everyone to play and enjoy had become a long dream of mine, but I never got serious enough
                to really publish anything besides very small projects with a dear colleague and friend of mine
                while attending a game development course in unity at university. 
                I want this to change with my game Tavern Traveler and I want to take you along my journey.
                <br><br>
                This dev log is for you and me to read how I make my game from start to finish and how its core features
                work even if I had a longer break, so I can remember how certain things work.  
            </p>
            <br>
            <p style="margin: inherit;">
                I make most of the stuff for my games myself including graphics, music and sounds.
                If you want to play my games I made in unity you can do so <a href="https://simmer.io/@Dragonfly">here</a> on simmer.io.
