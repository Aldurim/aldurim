                Tavern Traveler is a 2D action rpg with rouge lite elements that focus on combat and exploration alike.
                The game's combat system is heavily inspired by <a href="http://sloclap.com"> Absolver</a> made by Sloclap
                while trying to accomplish a similar graphics style between <a href="https://hibernian-workshop.com/dark-devotion/">Dark Devotion</a> made by Hibernian Workshop
                and <a href="https://www.kingdomthegame.com/">Kingdom</a> made by Thomas van den Berg and Marco Bancale
                but with a lower pixel resolution of 16 by 16 pixels.

                    As a member of the kings special unit called the cloaks
                    you are tasked to investigate an incident that took place in one of Ryn's shrines.
                    What you are about to discover never should have happened...

                In Tavern Traveler, your journey starts at the coast of Yara and continues through its mainland until you reach Ryn.
                During your journey, you will travel between taverns that shelter you. The roads between are full of dangers, 
                you have to overcome by fighting all kinds of foes.
                <br><br>
                In a typical action based game, 
                the player performs attacks and attack combos depending on the weapon he is holding and what buttons he is pressing. 
                Those attacks and combos are always the same depending on your weapon. However, in Tavern Traveler you can select
                from a set of moves represented as cards for a certain type of weapon deciding for yourself how your player moves while attacking,
                therefore creating your own flow and individual combat style. Each move comes with its special ability like breaking block,
                avoiding certain attacks, causing elemental damage and more. To use a card, you have to match its demanding attributes. 
                Attributes are for example your constitution, strength, dexterity, etc...
                <br><br>
                At the start of the game you can choose a starting
                class which is giving you some starting attributes and a deck of random cards you can build your own attack flow from. 
                Should you die, that's it. All that's left are the cards you didn't had in your build, waiting for the next cloak in the last
                tavern you visited. Your skills and attributes are lost forever. You can have multiple characters, but only ever play one of them.
                They can be switched at a tavern. An older character can be a teacher for a younger one, so even the older character dies,
                not all progress is lost.

                    Hi, my name is Markus Hecker. I am a student at the Ruhr-University Bochum in germany 
                    during my master's degree in IT-Security. Since I was 13 I love making games in my free time
                    what's probably the reason I learned programming in the first place.
                    Making a game for everyone to play and enjoy had become a long dream of mine, but I never got serious enough
                    to really publish anything besides very small projects with a dear colleague and friend of mine
                    while attending a game development course in unity at university. 
                    I want this to change with my game Tavern Traveler and I want to take you along my journey.
                    <br><br>
                    This dev log is for you and me to read how I make my game from start to finish and how its core features
                    work even if I had a longer break, so I can remember how certain things work.  
                </p>
                <br>
                <p class="body">
                    I make most of the stuff for my games myself including graphics, music and sounds.
                    If you want to play my games I made in unity you can do so <a href="https://simmer.io/@Dragonfly">here</a> on simmer.io.
